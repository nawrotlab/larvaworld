Larvaworld web-based apps

A number of web-based applications are available to inspect larva models, test isolated behavioral modules, view replays of stored datasets and launch simulations of behavioral experiments.
The apps can be launched via a single webpage by clicking on their respective icons.

Launch the web server via the CLI command :

>> larvaworld-app

Then open http://localhost:5006 in your browser (if not automatically opened).
